# attrition-pipeline

A simple pipeline that updates and aggregates data via SQLite, pulls data from the SQLite database, performs a logistic regression learning algorithm, and stores some of the relevant results in a pickel file.

This is a mock example of a machine learning program that intakes user data to learn employee attrition trends.
